\index{Albion}

	Albion is a nation consisting primarily of the island of Albia, of western Ullr.  The island takes its name from the state, as opposted to vice versa, "Albion" originally being a dynastic name of sorts, describing a duchy that originated from the mainland.  Although Albion was forced to migrate across the East Sea against their will some thousand years ago, this proved to be fortuitous, as the relative isolation and hospitable terrain preserved the nation.  Many of its contemporaries, lacking the natural defense the sea provided, fell to the sword of invaders.  Albion expanded into the vacuum their demise created, which facilitated the rise of one of the greatest empires of the Middle and Imperial eras.

	Albion has been best known as one of the two founding members of the East Sea Commonwealth, for its extensive new world colonial empire, and for the invention of the railway.
