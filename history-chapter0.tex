\lettrine[findent=2pt]{\fbox{\textbf{T}}}{ }he original version of this text was a compilation of Tetk’in \textit{Zamaru}. It began with a traditional chant of the 18 Holy Names, which are often collected into this Orison, known as the \textit{Elul Orison} and spoken at the beginning of endeavors for the Tetk'in. It is only appropriate that we begin this more modern version of this text in similar fashion.
