\textit{``But should the tribes of man fall into sin and anger the six greatest mountains too severely, all six will proclaim their fiery rage in tandem, and humanity will be removed from the world in their entirety.''} \footnote{Legate Harald III, \textit{A Canon of Skadun for the Masses}, 413 AC}\\



Of the world religions that emerged in ancient times few survive, and fewer still exert an equal or greater influence now than they did in the past. One of those faiths that survived the test of time is Skadunism (Clerical Altyrian: \textit{Ska\textipa{D\'u}n}), a family of animistic faiths identified by apocalypticism, a strong clergy presence, and a focus on penitence. Though sometimes considered a Toran Era faith, the roots of Skadunism reach back into the prehistory of Ullr.
